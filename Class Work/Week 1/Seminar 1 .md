## Task 1 ##

### Introduce Yourself ###
Hello, my name is Imogene Garthwaie and I am a Second Year Computer Science Student with a deeply entrenched love for history 

### A Brief Introduction on your own AI Project ###
My AI project is a medieval manuscript reader/learning tool, it uses natural language processing and image analysis to help analyse manuscripts 

### Why did you choose this product? why do you think its promising? ###
As a history buff who doesn't neccessarly have any expertise, I noticed the lack of coherent reliable resources especially in medieval languages, I then realised if i'm thinking this then i'm sure other people wpould want to have something like this product, especially hisotry students 

### Are there any other details you'd like to share? ###
I'm currently developing a MVP but im more focusing on early medieval insular manuscripts with Latin text and old irish.

## Task 2 ##
## To what extent are the following computer systems instances of artifical intelligence

### 1. Supermarket Bar Code Scanners - Not AI ###

### 2. Voice Activated Telephone - Moderate, useds speech recognition but it's limited ###

### 3. Spelling + Grammar Correction in Word - Moderate to High, uses machine learning models and language processing 


### Project Management Tools ###
- Kanban Board
- Flow Charts
- Gant Charts
