## The 4 Views of Artificial Intelligence: ##

#### Thinking Humanly ####
- View which sees AI as machines with minds just like us, making decisions and coming to conclusions just like us
- It's concerned with thought processes and reasoning
- It measures success in terms of fidelity to human performance
##### Example: The Turing Test #####
- Designed to provide a satisfactory operational defintion of intelligence
- A computer passes if a human can not tell is the response was written by a human or a computer
##### Example: The Cognitiive Modelling Approach #####
This apporach says that to see if a computer thinks like a human we need to actually know what it means to think like a human and understand the actualy workings of human minds 
Three ways to test this is ...
1) Through introspection
2) Through Psychological Experiments
3) Through Brain imaging 
  
#### Thinking Rationally ####
- View praises AI as being a completly rational agent which makes it possible to react and reason as well as perceive stuff in the most rational way possible 
- It's concerned with thought processes and reasoning
- It measures against an ideal performance measure called rationality
##### Example: The "Laws of thought" Approach #####
- Takes into account logic
- The gap comes in the fact that there is a large gap between solving something in principle and then translating this to actuality
- 
#### Acting Humanly ####
- View focuses on creating machines that perforem functions that requires the same kind of intelligence we expect from humans
- It measures success in terms of fidelity to human performance
- It addresses behaviour

  
#### Acting Rationally ####
- Now it focuses on executing a completley rational decison process, actually following through with it
- It measures against an ideal performance measure called rationality 
- It addresses behaviour
- ##### Example: The rational agent Approach #####
- Computer Agents are expected to operate autonomously, percieve their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals
- A rational agents acts to achieve the best outcome
- Acting rationally doesn't have to be a slow thoughtout outcome, you can recoil from touching a hot plate via reflexes and it is the most rational option
