## The Task at Hand

The project is about using a real-world example, in this case a dataset for a rational taxi agent that operates in a "grid" of London.

The brief talks about the **agent + environment + rationality paradigm**.

### Agent
Anything that perceives its environment through sensors and then acts on the environment through actuators.
### Environment
Anything outside the agent that can be interacted with.
### Rationality
Refers to an agent who, given certain knowledge, can make the best decision to maximise efficiency.



#### The environment ####
I'm working with a grid structure representing London
- This means that some cells will be specific locations, some will be blocked to represent traffic and others will be pickup/drop off points
- The grid must at least be a minimum of 5 x 5

#### The actions ####
At a min there needs to be movement of North, South, East and West but im going to do: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW

#### Performance Metrics ####
There has to be a performance metric to measure efficiency and it must be defined, In order to tackle this i'm going to have to write out a key of what i want ot include and the point system thtat ensues 

#### Decision-Making Methood ####
 I need to create a separate file expalining my decision making strategy, why i choose it , when it works well and when it fails

#### Running Scenarios ###
I need to basicaly.l create 3 user stories and use that as a test to show my working agent it will have: total score, steps taken and whther the goal was achieved. This needs to be reflective of the research document I do 

In order for a stronger report i need to explain in detail why each move was taken at every stage showing its rationility in the process 

There needs to be a focus on limitations too and possible ideas for future development 

#### Code ####
This is something that I need to code, my coding skills aren't very strong so this will probably be the harderst point, in order to get good at this I just need to do all the labs and apply the search algorithms already provided 

#### Smarter Metrics ####
This referes to other ways to measure success so maybe I can look at the grid for where there are the least fines, or a carpooling system 

#### Report ####
I need to frame my problem as an agent i nan environment with objecticve 

- Additional research can include acknowledging environmental costs and accessibility

- Implement 2 agents with different search algorithms 
- Look into taxis facing fines for speed
