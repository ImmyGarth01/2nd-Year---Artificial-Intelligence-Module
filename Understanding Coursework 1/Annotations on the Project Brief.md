## The Task at Hand

The project is about using a real-world example, in this case a dataset for a rational taxi agent that operates in a "grid" of London.

The brief talks about the **agent + environment + rationality paradigm**.

### Agent
Anything that perceives its environment through sensors and then acts on the environment through actuators.
### Environment
Anything outside the agent that can be interacted with.
### Rationality
Refers to an agent who, given certain knowledge, can make the best decision to maximise efficiency.



#### The environment ####
I'm working with a grid structure representing London
- This means that some cells will be specific locations, some will be blocked to represent traffic and others will be pickup/drop off points
- The grid must at least be a minimum of 5 x 5

#### The actions ####
At a min there needs to be movement of North, South, East and West but im going to do: N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW
