# General Research Notes #

For my real-world problem I'm thinking of using my search algorithm to avoid speed cameras and zones in the local London Borough of Sutton. This is because it is a problem that i've noticed with all that i'm in a car with exclaiming "why is this main road a 20 when there aren't even any pathways" "A classic example of the government trying to get your moneyand punish the working man", now in the context of my local area and the taxi agent theme I am aware that my borough has two hospitals, St Helier and the Royal Marsden, I also know from a night out incident involving a car accident which I observed that the average waiting time for an ambulance they told me would be 40 minutes, she couldnt feel her legs or back and was in and out of conciousness. Although sources online say it is 7 minutes for an emergency in my real world experience this simply isn't true. Therefore for my project i'd like to propose that I create a private ambulance/taxi route tracker that searches for the fastest routes to each hospital from a selected starting point, it is also of note that according to the most recent census, 57% of the population is 35 and over, which is also a point in which UCL have stated that Over a third of adults have multiple health problems in midlife, seen in the article of the same name. And as the World Health organisation points out, this ageing population is going to increase.
