## The Task at Hand

The project is about using a real-world example, in this case a dataset for a rational taxi agent that operates in a "grid" of London.

The brief talks about the **agent + environment + rationality paradigm**.

### Agent
Anything that perceives its environment through sensors and then acts on the environment through actuators.

### Environment
Anything outside the agent that can be interacted with.

### Rationality
Refers to an agent who, given certain knowledge, can make the best decision to maximise efficiency.
